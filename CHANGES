* Added GoogleCheckoutError#to_s to return verbose representation.
* Split google4r into google4r-checkout and google4r-maps.
* MerchantCode#create_from_element raises an ArgumentError instead of a RuntimeError on invalid elements now.
* Changed the #create_from_element code to set the properties directly into the objects instead of building Hashes to collect the values first.
* "Resolved" the problem of converting currency amounts which are fractional numbers into the amount of the minor currency to be passed into the Money class: Instead of converting the fractional number into a float and multiplying by 100, all nonnumeric characters are stripped from the string, the resulting number is converted into an integer and this integer is then passed to Money.new.
* Added example to NotificationHandler of how to use the class.
* Added link to simple_http_auth plugin in NotificationHandler which allows for easy HTTP Auth Basic protection of Rails controllers.

* Added support for registering GUnload() to be called on window's unload event.
* The generated Javascript that creates the GMap2() instance (and thus modifies the map div) has been put into a function <var name>_loader that is called in  an onload handler. This should remove a problem with MSIE.
* Using Syck as the YAML parser now. However, a workaround is needed because of http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/syck/ticket/27.
* Only require the json gem if objects have no "to_json" method already added to them. This solves a problem with converting arbitrary objects to json because the json gem seemingly only converts simple types.

* Added support for onclick handlers in markers.
* Added support for the value :auto of GMap2#zoom and GMap2#center.
* Fixed buggy generation of GMarker Javascript.
* Adding website folder to contain a webgen based website.
* Fixed a problem with generating XML from Hashes in the "private" data of shopping carts and items.

* Extending Google4R::Maps by the classes GMap2, GIcon and GMarker to allow for easy Google Maps HTML generation.
